## Setup

1. Clone the repository and open the created directory

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/openstatushq/openstatus.git
   cd openstatus
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Database setup

We are using Turso for the database to make it work locally you need to install
it and run it.

If you are on a mac install it with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```sh
brew tap chiselstrike/tap
brew install turso
```

then run it locally with

```sh
turso dev --db-file openstatus.db
```

Here is the official Turso
[installation guide](https://docs.turso.tech/reference/turso-cli)

4. Run the database migration

In the `packages/db` folder run

```sh
pnpm migrate
```

5. Set up your .env file

from `apps/web` and `packages/db` you will find .env.example. Please create your
own.

6. Start the web app locally

```sh
pnpm dev
```

> Then `cd` into web directory and then start the web app
