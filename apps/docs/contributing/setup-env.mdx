# Configuration of the .env file

The `.env` file contains various environment variables that need to be properly
configured for the application to work correctly. Below, I will explain how to
obtain the values for some of these variables, focusing on the section related
to Cleark Auth.

## Setting up Resend for sending emails

The "RESEND for email" section in the `.env` file contains the "RESEND_API_KEY"
variable, which corresponds to the Resend API key that you need to set up to
send emails.

Here's how to obtain the Resend API key:

1. Access the Resend website at [https://resend.com](https://resend.com) and log
   in with your account or create a new account if you don't have one.

2. Once you've logged in, look for the option to add a new API Key. You can do
   this by clicking the corresponding button or navigating to the "API Keys"
   section and creating it from there.

3. Fill in the necessary information to create the API Key, such as the name and
   required permissions.

4. Once the API Key is created, copy its value, which usually starts with "re\_"
   and includes a series of characters.

5. Paste this API Key value into the `.env` file under the "RESEND_API_KEY"
   variable. It should look something like this (real values without
   censorship):

![Create your monitor](/images/setup-env/resend.png)

```
# RESEND for email
RESEND_API_KEY=re_••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
```

Replace the key with the actual Resend API key you obtained from your Resend
account.

## Setting up Upstash (QStash and Redis)

The "Upstash for queue" section in the `.env` file contains the following
variables related to QStash and Redis:

```
# UPSTASH for queue
QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY=qstash-current-signing-key
QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY=qstash-next-signing-key
QSTASH_TOKEN=qstash-token
QSTASH_URL=https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/publish/


# UPSTASH redis for waiting list
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=test
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=test
```

To configure UPSTASH correctly, follow these steps:

### Obtaining QStash Keys

1. Log in to your UPSTASH account at
   [https://upstash.com/](https://upstash.com/) or create a new account if you
   don't have one yet.

2. Once logged in, go to
   [https://console.upstash.com/qstash](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and
   copy the keys you need one by one. These keys are
   "QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY", "QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY", and "QSTASH_TOKEN".

3. Paste these keys into the `.env` file under their respective variables. It
   should look something like this (real values without censorship):

```
# UPSTASH for queue
QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY=sig_•••••••••••••••••••••••••
QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY=sig_•••••••••••••••••••••••••
QSTASH_TOKEN=ey••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
QSTASH_URL=https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/publish/
```

Replace the ellipsis with the actual keys you obtained from UPSTASH.

### Configuring Redis

> We have been using Redis for the waiting list in this project. It is not used
> currently. However, if you want to use it, you can follow the steps below to.

1. Create a Redis database in UPSTASH through
   [https://console.upstash.com/](https://console.upstash.com/).

2. Once the database is created, access "Details" and go to the "API REST"
   section, selecting the `.env` tab.

3. Copy the URL and token information displayed there and paste them in the
   `.env` file under the following variables:

```
# UPSTASH redis for waiting list
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL="https://•••••••••.upstash.io"
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN="•••••••••"
```

Replace the ellipsis with the actual URL and token of Redis you obtained from
UPSTASH.

## Setting up Tinybird

You will need to create an API token, Go to Auth tokens > Workspace tokens > Add
a new token > Select your token

![Create your monitor](/images/setup-env/tinybird.png)

```
# TinyBird
TINY_BIRD_API_KEY="•••••••••"
```

The [Tinybird CLI](https://www.tinybird.co/docs/cli.html) can be used to push
the pipes to the Tinybird server.

### Datasource

We ingest the monitor response into the `ping_response__v5` table. If you want
to have some dummy data to start with, check out the
[csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openstatusHQ/openstatus/main/apps/docs/dummy/ping_response__v5.csv)
file.

> Warning: If importing the csv file, make sure to change the column names are
> identical (e.g. `monitorId` instead of `monitorid`). Otherwise, the pipes will
> not work.

### Pipes

The pipes we are using can be found under `@packages/tinybird/pipes`. Pipes are
used to transform data from one format to another. For example, we are using a
pipe to transform the data from the database `ping_response` into aggregated
data.

We currently have three pipes:

1. `status_timezone__v0`: returns aggregated data from the `ping_response`
   table.
2. `response_list__v0`: returns the list of responses from the `ping_response`
   table.
3. `home_stats__v0`: returns the total amount of pings during a timeframe from
   the `ping_response` table.

## Setting up Turso (SQLite or Cloud Database)

The "TURSO SQLITE" section in the `.env` file allows you to configure Turso
database, either a local SQLite database or a cloud-based database.

### If you want to use a local database (optional):

To begin, install sqld with brew. If you don't have brew installed, we recommend
installing it from [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/) which works on macOS or Linux, or
WSL if you are using Windows.

```bash
brew tap libsql/sqld
brew install sqld-beta
```

Next, you can use the following command to start Turso with a SQLite database:

```bash
turso dev --db-file openstatus.db
```

By doing this, you'll be able to work with the local database without modifying
the `.env` file.

### If you want to use a cloud-based database with Turso

To use a cloud-based database with Turso, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Turso account at [https://turso.tech/](https://turso.tech/) or
   create a new account if you don't have one yet.

2. If this is your first time using Turso, it may prompt you to install the
   client on your machine. Follow the steps provided on their website or refer
   to their documentation
   [https://docs.turso.tech/tutorials/get-started-turso-cli/step-01-installation](https://docs.turso.tech/tutorials/get-started-turso-cli/step-01-installation)
   for client installation.

3. Once you have successfully installed the Turso client, open your terminal and
   use the following command to authenticate:

```
turso auth login
```

4. Then, create a new database with the following command:

```
turso db create
```

Wait for a moment until the database is created, and you will be shown
information about the database, including a connection URL and an authentication
token.

5. Use the following commands to show the required information and create the
   database in the `.env` file:

```
turso db show db-name
turso db tokens create db-name
```

Replace "db-name" with the name of your database. You should get the generated
URL and token, which should be placed in the `.env` file as follows (real values
without censorship):

```
# TURSO SQLITE
DATABASE_URL=libsql://my-database-example.turso.io
DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN=ey••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
```

Remember to copy this information in both` app/web/.env` and `packages/db/.env`
and save the changes to the `.env` file once you have completed all the
configurations.

## **Connect datasource using tinybird-cli**

1. Log in to your tinybird account at https://www.tinybird.co/ or create a new
   account if you don't have one yet.

2. Once logged in, go to your dashboard and copy the auth token and paste inside
   `.env`

   > Please make sure you chose the admin token otherwise it may give an error
   > like auth token invalid

3. Then download this file
   [ping_response\_\_v5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openstatusHQ/openstatus/8d5c997aacd93becff2cf24ea1d08d33274d2c20/apps/docs/dummy/ping_response__v5.csv)

4. install the tinybird-cli

```
cd packages/tinybird
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install tinybird-cli

```

5. Create a datasource from this file

   > Please make sure while importing you edit the table header fields in
   > camelcase .

6. Create pipe from the datasource name as a `response_list__v1` and
   `status_timezone__v0`

7. Inside `response_list__v0` pipe, create a endpoint by running a following
   query :

```
%
    SELECT id, latency, monitorId, pageId, region, statusCode, timestamp, url, workspaceId, cronTimestamp
    FROM ping_response__v4
    WHERE monitorId = {{ String(monitorId, 'openstatusPing') }}
    {% if defined(region) %}
    AND region = {{ String(region) }}
    {% end %}
    {% if defined(cronTimestamp) %}
    AND cronTimestamp = {{ Int64(cronTimestamp) }}
    {% end %}
    {% if defined(fromDate) %}
    AND cronTimestamp >= {{ Int64(fromDate) }}
    {% end %}
    {% if defined(toDate) %}
    AND cronTimestamp <= {{ Int64(toDate) }}
    {% end %}
    ORDER BY timestamp DESC
    LIMIT {{Int32(limit, 1000)}}
```

8. Inside `status_timezone__v0` pipe , create a endpoint by running a following
   query :

```
VERSION 0

NODE group_by_cronTimestamp
SQL >

    %
    SELECT
        toDateTime(cronTimestamp / 1000, 'UTC') AS day,
        -- only for debugging purposes
        toTimezone(day, {{ String(timezone, 'Europe/Berlin') }}) as with_timezone,
        toStartOfDay(with_timezone) as start_of_day,
        avg(latency) AS avgLatency,
        count() AS count,
        count(multiIf((statusCode >= 200) AND (statusCode <= 299), 1, NULL)) AS ok
    FROM ping_response__v4
    WHERE
        (day IS NOT NULL)
        AND (day != 0)
        AND monitorId = {{ String(monitorId, '1') }}
        -- By default, we only only query the last 45 days
        AND cronTimestamp >= toUnixTimestamp64Milli(
            toDateTime64(toStartOfDay(date_sub(DAY, 45, now())), 3)
        )
    GROUP BY cronTimestamp, monitorId
    ORDER BY day DESC



NODE group_by_day
SQL >

    %
    SELECT
        start_of_day as day,
        sum(count) as count,
        sum(ok) as ok,
        round(avg(avgLatency)) as avgLatency
    FROM group_by_cronTimestamp
    GROUP BY start_of_day
    ORDER BY start_of_day DESC
    LIMIT {{ Int32(limit, 100) }}


```

### Setting up the database

We have an example database that you can use to get started. You can run it with
the following command:

```bash
 turso dev --db-file openstatus-dev.db
```

It contains some dummy data that you can use to test the application.

![Drizzle studio](/images/setup-env/drizzle-studio.png)

```bash
cd packages/db
pnpm studio
```

## Conclusion

Once you have collected all the necessary information, you should save it in the
`.env` file to ensure proper configuration for your application. Following these
steps will enable your application to function effectively with the appropriate
settings for each service.

Open this url http://localhost:3000/app/love-openstatus to start using the app.
