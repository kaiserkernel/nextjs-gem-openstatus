# Create your first monitor

## What is a monitor? 🧑‍🏫

A monitor is a job that runs periodically and checks the status of a service. It
can be a website, an API, or anything else that can be checked automatically.

## Configure your monitor 🛠

A monitor requires a few things to be configured:

- an endpoint to check 🔗
- a check interval ⏰
- a region to run the check from 🌍

## Advanced configuration 🧙‍♂️

Sometimes you need to configure your monitor more precisely.

- set a Method (GET, POST) 🧭
- set a custom HTTP Headers (usefull if your endpoi nt is secured) 🔑
- set a custom HTTP Body (for POST request only) 📦

> Create an API key and use it in your HTTP Headers to create your monitor
> programmatically API.
