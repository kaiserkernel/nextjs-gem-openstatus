# Auth Token

In your Settings, you can create and later revoke your API token. Once created,
it will be shown only once so keep it safe.

On every request to `https://api.openstatus.dev/v1`, you'll have to attach the
token to the header.

```ts
const monitors = await fetch(`https://api.openstatus.dev/v1/monitors`, {
  method: "GET",
  headers: new Headers({
    "x-openstatus-key": "os_xxxxxxxxx",
  }),
});
```

Use the above snippet to try it out.

We currently do not have an SDK to make the best out of it. Any contributions
are welcome.

The API infrastructure is powered by [Unkey](https://unkey.dev).
