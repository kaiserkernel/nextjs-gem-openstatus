## Problem

The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it. Authorization will not help. That most likely indicates your account doesn't have the necessary permissions to execute the request.

## Solution

Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute the request. You might want to upgrade your workspace plan.

If that doesn't help, ask for help on [Discord](https://openstatus.dev/discord).
