title: BAD_REQUEST
openapi-schema: ErrBadRequest
---

## Problem

The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).

## Solution

Check the request response and making sure it's correct.

If that doesn't help, ask for help on [Discord](https://openstatus.dev/discord).
