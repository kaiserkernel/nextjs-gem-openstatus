## What is a monitor? 🧑‍🏫

A monitor is a job that runs periodically and checks the status of a service. It
can be a website, an API, or anything else that can be checked automatically.

## Configure your monitor 🛠

Your endpoint check requires:

- a **name** to identify your monitor
- the **URL** to checked

We will store the **response time** and the **status code** of your endpoint.

  />
</Frame>

### HTTP Request 📤

Customize the request sent to your endpoint.

Choose between one of the request **HTTP Method**: `GET` (default), `POST` or
`HEAD`.

Add custom key-value **HTTP Headers** to your request.

> OpenStatus automatically appends the `"OpenStatus-Ping": "true"` header to
> your request. This header is used to identify the request as a ping request
> and can be exluded from your analytics.

If you select the `POST` method, you can add a custom **HTTP Body** to your
request.

### Advanced Configuration ⏱️

Define the **frequency** of your checks. You can choose between: `1m`, `5m`,
`10m` (default), `30min` or `1h`.

By default, **all regions** are enabled. You can disable some regions if you
want to. Leaving it empty will check your endpoint from a random region.

The **description** is optional. If defined, an `Info` tooltip will be added to
your monitor name.

You can always pause your monitor with the **active** switch button.

### Notifications 🔔

Get informed whenever a check fails. You can add multiple notification channels.

We send a webhook to Slack or Discord channels. Or you can also receive an
email.
