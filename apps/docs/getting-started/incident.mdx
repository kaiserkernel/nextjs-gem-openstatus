description: "How to create your first incident ğŸ”¥"
---

When creating an incident, you can map it to either to a **status page** or to a
**monitor**. This will allow you access the latest incidents on your status
page.

Update your incident over time and keep your users informed. Add a new
**status**, **date** and **message** to your incident. They will be displayed on
a timeline.
