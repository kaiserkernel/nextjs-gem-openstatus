description: "How does OpenStatus' synthetic monitoring work?"
---

With synthetic monitoring, you can simulated requests to monitor the availability and performance of
your website or API from various locations around the world.

We will make a request to your website or API on a regular schedule and record the
responses.

We will alert you if your website or API is down, slow or does not return the expected response.

You can create monitors in our dashboard, with the <a href="/api-reference/monitor/post-monitor">API</a> or with <a href="/packages/terraform">Terraform</a>.

## Locations 🌍

## Status Page 📃

Status page are a great way to communicate with your users when your website or API is down.

You can create a status page to display the availability and the performance of your
monitors to your users.

## Alerting 🚨

Don't wait for your users to tell you that your website or API is down.

You can configure alerts to be notified when your monitor is down or slow, or does not return the expected response.
