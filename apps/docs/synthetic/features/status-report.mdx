## What is a Status Page Report?

A status page report is a timeline of status updates that can be shared with your users. It is a great way to keep your users informed about the status of your application, website or service.

## How to create a Status Page Report?

Go the the **Status Page Report** tab and click on the **Create Report** button.

When creating a status report, you can map it to either to a **status page** or
to a **monitor**. This will allow you access the latest reports on your status
page.

Update your report over time and keep your users informed. Add a new **status**,
**date** and **message** to your report. They will be displayed on a timeline.
