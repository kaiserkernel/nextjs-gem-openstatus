## What is a monitor? 🧑‍🏫

A monitor is a job that runs periodically and checks the status of a service. It
can be a website, an API, or anything else that can be checked automatically.

## Configure your monitor 🛠

Your endpoint check requires:

- a **name** to identify your monitor
- the **URL** to checked

We will store the **response time**, the **status code**, the **headers**
returned, and the **timing metrics** of your endpoint.

### HTTP Request 📤

Customize the request sent to your endpoint.

Choose between one of the request **HTTP Method**: `GET` (default), `POST` or
`HEAD`.

Add custom key-value **HTTP Headers** to your request.

> OpenStatus automatically set the `"User-Agent": "OpenStatus/1.0"` header to
> your request. This header is used to identify the request as a ping request
> and can be exluded from your analytics.

If you select the `POST` method, you can add a custom **HTTP Body** to your
request.

### Advanced Configuration ⚙️

You can pause your monitor with the **active** switch button.

#### Frequency ⏱

Define the **frequency** of your checks. You can choose between: `30s`, `1m`,
`5m`, `10m` (default), `30min` or `1h`.

#### Regions 🌍

By default, **all regions** are enabled. You can disable some regions if you
want to. Our regions are:

- `ams` - Amsterdam, Netherlands - 🇳🇱
- `iad` - Ashburn, Virginia, USA - 🇺🇸
- `jnb` - Johannesburg, South Africa - 🇿🇦
- `hkg` - Hong Kong, Honkg Kong - 🇭🇰
- `gru` - Sao Paulo, Brazil - 🇧🇷
- `syd` - Sydney, Australia - 🇦🇺

#### Description 📝

The **description** is optional. If defined, an `Info` tooltip will be added to
your monitor name.

#### Timeout ⏳

You can define a **timeout** for your request. The default value is `30s`.

#### Assertions 🧪

You can add **assertions** to your monitor. An assertion is a condition that
needs to be met for the monitor to be considered successful.

You can add multiple assertions to your monitor.

We currently support the following assertions on the following fields:

- **Status Code**
- **Response Body**
