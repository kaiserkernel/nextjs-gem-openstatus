---

With our real user monitoring, you can track the performance of your website
from your users' browsers.

You install a small JavaScript snippet on your website, and we will record the
performance metrics of your website for each user.

## Metrics ðŸ“Š

We are currently tracking the following metrics:

- **TTFB**: Time to First Byte
- **FCP**: First Contentful Paint
- **LCP**: Largest Contentful Paint
- **CLS**: Cumulative Layout Shift
- **INP**: Interaction to Next Paint

## Get started ðŸš€

We currently only support NextJS applications, other frameworks are coming soon.

To get started, you need to install our package in your application.

```bash
pnpm add @openstatus/next-monitoring -E
```

Then, you need to add the following snippet to your `layout.tsx` file:

```tsx
import { OpenStatusProvider } from "@openstatus/next-monitoring";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>
        <OpenStatusProvider dsn="YOUR_DSN" />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```
