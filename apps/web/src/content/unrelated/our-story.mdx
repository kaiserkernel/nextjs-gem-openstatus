## Our story 📜

We met on Twitter in 2023, after couple of months of DM. We started to work on
OpenStatus and were driven by these goals:

- Build something useful for other developers 🧑‍💻
- A real-world project with all the latest hot technologies 🌶️
- Be Open-Source 📖

## Our values ⚖️

We are a small team of 2 people, we are a small company. We are not a VC funded
startup. We are not looking for investors. We want to keep our freedom and build
a substainable business while working on features that provides the best value
to our users.

We also want to be transparent about our business. We are not going to hide our
ups and downs. We are going to share our journey with you.

## Our mission 🚀

We want to make the web faster and more reliable for everyone, wherever they are
in the world. To achieve this, we are building a platform that helps developers
monitor their websites and APIs.

We are here to fight Us-East-1 privilege. ⚔️
