We have added auto-resolved incidents to the incident management feature. Now,
once your endpoint is back up and running i.e. _more than 50% of the regions are
not failing_, the incident will be automatically resolved. The time between the
creation and resolution of the incident will be marked as downtime on the status
page.

Additionally, the calculated `p95` latency over a day has been removed. It is
costly to calculate and was not providing much value.

Instead, we are thinking of adding a chart that shows the latency of the last X
days/hours. If you have ideas, [let us know](/discord)!
