You can deploy our checker within your infrastructure, any cloud providers or coolify by pulling the image from the container registry.

The image is available at `ghcr.io/openstatushq/checker:latest`.

It opens up a lot of possibilities to run the checker in your own environment, on your own infrastructure, or on any cloud provider. We will be able to add private locations soon.

We have wrote a [guide](https://docs.openstatus.dev/guides/how-deploy-checker-koyeb) to help you deploy our checker on [Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/).

Thanks to [Depot](https://depot.dev/?utm_source=Opource=OpenStatus) for the fast build and the easy integration with GitHub Actions.
