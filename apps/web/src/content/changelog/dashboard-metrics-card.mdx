You can now see more insights into your services with the new metrics card on
the monitor's overview.

Choose a period and see the: **uptime** percentage, number of **errors**, number
of **total requests**, **average**, **p99**, **p95**, **p90**, and **p75**
response times - and compare the metrics with the previous period.

You'll also notice that you can now filter the charts by **region** and combine
or split the regions separately for simpler comparison.

Additionally, we've updated the monitor settings section to improve the UI/UX.

So go to your [dashboard](/app) to check it out!
