You can now protect your status page with a password. This will hide the page
from the public and only allow access to users with the password.

You can enable the password protection from the status page within the
_Visibility_ settings. You will be able to:

- Enable the feature with a simple checkbox to easily turn it on and off
- Set your password
- Share the protected page with a `?authorize=your-password` query parameter to
  auto-complete the password field

> This feature is available on the Starter plan and above.
