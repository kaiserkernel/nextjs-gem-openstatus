We have added a new API to launch a check with OpenStatus. You can now test your endpoint's latency programmatically.

It's useful if you want to integrate OpenStatus with your CI/CD pipeline.

You can read the [API documentation](https://docs.openstatus.dev/api-reference/check/post-check) or our guide to integrate it in [GitHub Actions](https://docs.openstatus.dev/guides/test-latency-cf-workers-in-github-actions) to get started.
