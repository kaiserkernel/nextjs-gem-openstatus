You can now set your status to _Under Maintenance_ to inform your users that you're performing maintenance. You'll be able to set the start and end times for the maintenance period. During this time, we will pause the connected monitors and suppress any notifications.

To create a maintenance, go to the corresponding status page and click the 'Maintenance' sub navigation. From there, you can create a new maintenance status, including `title` and `description`.

The users will be able to see all maintenances under a new tab on the status page.
