The endpoint health checker has been improved to be more stable and reliable
with [Go](https://go.dev). In the past, we have been experiencing missing data
endpoints and longer request times for some `regions`.

In addition to that, we have renamed the **Incidents** to **Status Reports** to
easily distinguish between internal incidents and external reports.

> The API endpoint has also moved from `/v1/incidents` to `/v1/status_reports`.
> Read more in the [docs](https://docs.openstatus.dev/getting-started/incident).
