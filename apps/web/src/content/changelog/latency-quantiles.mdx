You can now refine your latency data more effectively with quantiles: `p99`,
`p95`, `p90`, and `p75`. The average (`avg`) has been retained.

The `<Tracker />` data on your status pages now displays the `p95` quantile
instead of the average.

Furthermore, the `/monitors` layout has been updated. The data table has its
dedicated tab to prevent loading excessive data at once, along with the edit
form. The pause button is also now more quickly accessible.
