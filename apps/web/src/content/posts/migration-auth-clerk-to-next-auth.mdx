We recently switched from [Clerk](https://clerk.com) to NextAuth
([Auth.js](https://authjs.dev)) for our authentication. Now, let's explore the
reasons for this decision.

## Why did we migrate from Clerk to NextAuth (Auth.js)? ü§î

First, Clerk is an amazing product. But we are building an open-source project
and creating an account on Clerk, setting up social login, and routing the
webhook to localhost was a pain for new contributors as it required a tunnel to
`localhost:3000` via e.g. [ngrok](https://ngrok.com).

Our goal is to improve the contributor experience (CX) for OpenStatus by
speeding up the time to first line of code. _#TTFLOC_

Our efforts have already simplified the process significantly. With SQLite and
now NextAuth, we can seed the DB and login with an email (magic link gets
printed in the console) within less than a minute.

## Why did we start with Clerk? üßë‚Äçüíª

When we started OpenStatus, we needed a way to authenticate users. We wanted to
make it easy for users to sign up for our platform. Clerk was a good choice for
us because it provided a simple way to authenticate users.

The documentation is clear, the setup is straightforward, and it is working
flawlessly with Next.js App Router.

At the same time, NextAuth was starting a transition to Auth.js and while we
wanted to use the latest tech and have chosen
[drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team) over [prisma](https://www.prisma.io), there
was no proper adapter for it.

Back then, Clerk was the perfect fit.

## Why did we pick NextAuth (Auth.js) and not Lucia? üîë

First, when we thought about migrating from Clerk, we considered
[Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/). Lucia is an amazing authentication library
that is gaining popularity built by [Pilcrow](https://pilcrowonpaper.com/).

We were scared about the stability and direction of the project. When you
implement authentication, you want to do it once and forget about it after.

We decided to go with NextAuth because it was more mature, and it seemed more
stable to us. Additionally, we both had some experience with NextAuth. It was a
good choice for us as we did not have to learn a new library.

## How did we migrate from Clerk to NextAuth (Auth.js)? üöÄ

We were scared of the migration at first. We thought it would be long and hard.
But the migration was quite simple, as we were already storing most of the user
data in our database.

### What we already had in place

Whenever a user signed up with Clerk, we stored the `user`'s data in our
database. We had to store the `tenantId` from Clerk to be able to fetch map the
user, and we additionally stored `email`, `name`, `photoUrl`, and SQLite created
an additional primary key `id`.

All the other information of the user's social account (Google, GitHub OAuth)
was stored in Clerk.

### Starting with NextAuth

Whenever you start with NextAuth, you choose your DB/ORM adapter and create the
tables you need:

- `users`
- `sessions`
- `accounts`
- `verificationTokens`

With drizzle as our ORM, we followed the following steps from
[here](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/adapters/drizzle), including using
SQLite as schema.

Now because we already had the `users` table, we extended it with the necessary
fields or mappings in our
[extended adapter](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/openstatus/blob/main/apps/web/src/lib/auth/adapter.ts)
(e.g., we have kept the `photoUrl` field and did not use the `image` field from
NextAuth to store the social image of the user). NextAuth allows you to override
the adapter functions and that's what we did: we overrode the `getUser` and
`createUser` functions to match our current user db schema.

The other tables `sessions`, `accounts`, and `verificationTokens` were created
as is.

Now you might wonder: **How did we migrate the data?** We simply did not.

While Clerk has all the information for the social `accounts` of every user, we
are connecting the user to the account when they log in the next time with.
NextAuth provides a
[`allowDangerousEmailAccountLinking`](https://authjs.dev/reference/core/providers#allowdangerousemailaccountlinking)
property that re-links the `user` to the `account` when they log in with the
same email.

### Customizing the UI

We have been using Clerk's UI for a long time and swapped it with custom
components. But luckily our website is powered by
[shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com) and we could easily create the components.

## Conclusion

If you are building an open-source project, we recommend NextAuth. But if it's a
closed-source SaaS project, Clerk is a good choice.

We are happy with our decision to migrate from Clerk to NextAuth (Auth.js).
While we will miss some Clerk features (analytics), we look forward to exploring
what NextAuth offers us.

Our main PR for the migration is
[#801](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/openstatus/pull/801) while we implemented
the magic link for dev mode in
[#806](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/openstatus/pull/806) and improved the
types in [#807](https://github.com/openstatusHQ/openstatus/pull/807).
