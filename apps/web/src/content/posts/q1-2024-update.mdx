improve OpenStatus and make it the best open source platform for monitoring the
performance of your services.

## What to expect for the next quarter? ðŸ¤”

We are slowly rolling out Real User Monitoring (RUM) to all users. If you want
to be opted in in the beta program, send an email to
[ping@openstatus.dev](mailto:ping@openstatus.dev).

We are also working hard on improving our synthetic monitoring amd making it
more reliable.

We are also planing on making the platform more easily self hosted and remove
most of the external services we rely on. We want to switch from Clerk to either
NextAuth V5 or Lucia.
