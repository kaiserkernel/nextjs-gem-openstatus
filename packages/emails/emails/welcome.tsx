          Hey üëã
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm Thibault <a href="https://www.openstatus.dev">OpenStatus</a>{" "}
          co-founder.
          <br />
          <br /> I'm thrilled to see you joining us. We are building an
          open-source status page and monitoring tool. We are here to help you
          monitor your websites and API to get notified before your users alert
          you.
          <br />
          <br />
          Here are a few things you can do with OpenStatus:
          <br />- Use our{" "}
          <a href="https://docs.openstatus.dev/packages/terraform">
            Terraform providers
          </a>{" "}
          to manage your monitors
          <br />- Integrate your status within your application with our{" "}
          <a href="https://docs.openstatus.dev/packages/status-widget">
            API
          </a>{" "}
          and{" "}
          <a href="https://docs.openstatus.dev/packages/react">React Widget</a>
          <br />- Build your own status page with our <a href="">API</a> and
          host it where you want. Here's our{" "}
          <a href="https://github.com/openstatusHQ/astro-status-page">
            Astro template
          </a>{" "}
          that you can easily host on CloudFlare
          <br />
          <br />
          If you have any questions, just let me know.
          <br />
          Thank you,
          <br />
